      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you guys remember how hard school was when we were younger? 
        Do you wish it could have been easier? Though we are already done with school, 
        we strive to provide better educational materials for our children, and that’s where I can help. 
        My name is Adam Tyson and I make educational websites that provide materials for K-5 education, 
        allowing our children the extra education/materials that they’ll need in order to improve their skills 
        and hone them in their school work. This website will provide some materials for children learning basic
        subjects such as math and reading/writing. More updates will come!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is intended for parents, teachers, and students to use in order to practice what they may have learned
        in school. Think of this site as a place to get extra practice and tips in order to excel in school. For parents and teachers,
        they may use this material in order to work with their children and help them while checking their progress.

      <h3>Atedu</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Adam Tyson. I am a current college student that strives to share tips and tricks that will help younger students get ahead in their education career. Atedu is a platform that will help me do just that. Atedu is a free to use website that provides parents, guardians, teachers, and students the materials that young students will need to excel in their educational career. 
Tests like the ACT and the SAT contain questions that students at this age range could learn now, allowing them to master these skills and improve them many times over before they can take those tests. As someone that has taken the ACT many times, I know that the material found in those can be learned at this young age. 
My responsibility is to provide material that can help young students advance in their learning. Your responsibility as parents, guardians, teachers, or students, is to practice the material. The more time put into practice will ensure mastery of whatever subjects you choose to learn.

      <h3>Math</h3>
      <p>
        Math is the basic block of education that leads to a lot of careers in not only mathematics, but also physics, engineering, and a whole lot of other fields. For this reason, it is important to have a good understanding in the basics of math, which include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  In this page of Atedu, there will be many resources provided to practice any one of the previously mentioned basics of math. 
As you/your students get better at these basic forms of math, do not continue to the next thing just yet. The best exercise that a student can master after this is mental math or being able to do math in your head. Though this will take some time to learn (and even more time to master), this skill, when learned, will save you/your students a lot of time in the future. Of course, you will be allowed calculators when it is time for tests and other exams, but sometimes real-life situations will need you/your students to need to perform calculations right of the top of their head. 
To begin, have two people ask each other math questions. Whatever that question may be, begin to imagine how you would write that problem on a piece of paper. Once you have that image in your mind, begin to work on the problem as if you were doing it on a piece of paper. For beginners, hand motions are a welcome help in making sure you stay in the right place of the math problem. Continue this until you either finish the math problem or until you get lost. Do not lose hope though if you do get lost! Just start back to where you were having problems and keep going until you get it.

      </ul>
      <h3>Reading and Writing</h3>
      <p>
        Reading and writing is a form of communication with each other. The more we can understand the things that we are reading, and the better we are at writing to communicate our thoughts to others, the more understanding there will be with our audience (whoever that may be). In this part of Atedu will be materials to help you/your students find the main ideas found in text, as well as learning how to use different kinds of punctuations in order to more expertly send their ideas across to others. 
The main idea of a text is the subject/lesson that the author wants us to focus on. In general, the main idea can be found in the first paragraph of a text, though sometimes that is not the case. You can tell what the main idea is by the author constantly referring to what he/she wants to talk about. For example, a new article will begin with the main idea of the story in the first sentence of the first paragraph, allowing their audience to know what it is that they will talk about.
