    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Adam Tyson and I am a computer science major! 
    I love to play video games, listen to new music, and hike. I just got married 
    this time last year to my lovely wife Cambria who's in the photo with me above.</p>
    <p>I love BYU-Idaho. The spirit is so strong here. My time here has not only 
    grown my intellect, but it has deepened my connection to the sprit and to the Savior. 
    The more I keep abiding by the principles being taught here, the more I find
    that my family is blessed.</p>
