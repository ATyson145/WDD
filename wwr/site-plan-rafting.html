    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Do you guys like whitewater rafting? Well so do we! Here at Whitewater Rafting (WWR for short) we love to share
        with everyone the experiences that both we and all of you have had with whitewater rafting. In short, we will be posting 
        amazing stories that come from you guys in the hopes that we can all share our love of whitewater rafting with the world.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Generally, the audience that this website will have will be those who seek adventures in the most powerful of rivers 
        and other ways that get people excited. The target age will be anyone, as well as the location of the audience could be from
        any place in the world (so long as their is a river with some current.) This webiste will be a place where they can share stories
        with one another, allowing each other to get excited to go rafting again. This could also be an opportunity where they can 
        share tips and tricks into getting a better experience. The audience will most likely have to access this through a desktop,
        though a mobile framework would be amazing.
